Jack languages extensions

[x] compiler: support static string allocation (uses String OS class to do so)
[x] allow for single line if/while/else blocks without {}s
[ ] support operator priority ( 5 + 6 * 2 ) should be 17 not 60
[ ] add support for switch statements
[ ] add support for for loop statements
[ ] add support for float type
[ ] allow multiple classes per file

[ ] OS implement Memory.deFrag()

VM projects
------------------------------
[ ] implement a class the emulates the VM machine ( without keyboard input or display )
   (useful as a script language for any game with a sufficient game interface API)


Hardware projects
------------------------------
[ ] Build the hardware! 
  - Use VHDL / Verilog to rewrite the HDL programs from N2T1
  - Commit these programs to FPGA board (~$100)
  - Or use a free FPGA emulator software
